How to contribute
=================

We welcome contributions or suggestions from other developers and here
we provide a number of rules, suggestions and tips to help you
contribute to Giotto in a sustainable manner. Please contact us if you
have questions or would like to discuss an addition or major
modifications to the Giotto main code.

:math:`~`

Coding Style
------------

Following a particular programming style will help programmers read and
understand source code conforming to the style, and help to avoid
introducing errors. Here we present a small list of guidelines on what
is considered a good practice when writing R codes in Giotto package.
Most of them are adapted from `Bioconductor - coding
style <https://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/coding-style/>`__ or
`Google’s R Style
Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml>`__. These
guidelines are preferences and strongly encouraged!

-  **Indentation**

   -  Use 4 spaces for indenting. No tabs.
   -  Preferably no lines longer than 80 characters. This includes
      function documentations, examples, and vignette code chunks.

-  **Function names**

   -  Use camelCase.
   -  Do not use “.” (in the S3 class system, some(x) where x is class A
      will dispatch to some.A).
   -  Use underscores for non-exported functions, like
      ‘non_exported_function’.

-  **Use of space**

   -  Do not place a space before a comma, but always place one after a
      comma. This: a, b, c.
   -  Always use space around “=” when using named arguments to
      functions. This: somefunc(a = 1, b = 2).

-  **Use of symbols**

   -  Do not use any non-ASCII characters

Stat functions
--------------

Most Giotto commands can accept several matrix classes (DelayedMatrix,
SparseM, Matrix or base matrix). To facilitate this we provide
**flexible** wrappers that work on any type of matrix class. They can be
found in the
`utilities.R <https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto/blob/suite/R/utilities.R>`__
file.

-  **mean_flex**: analogous to mean()
-  **rowSums_flex**: analogous to rowSums()
-  **rowMeans_flex**: analogous to rowMeans()
-  **colSums_flex**: analogous to colSums()
-  **colMeans_flex**: analogous to colMeans()
-  **t_flex**: analogous to t()
-  **cor_flex**: analogous to cor()

Auxiliary functions
-------------------

Giotto has a number of auxiliary or convenience functions that might
help you to adapt your code or write new code for Giotto. We encourage
you to use these small functions to maintain uniformity throughout the
code.

-  **lapply_flex**: analogous to lapply() and works for both windows and
   unix systems
-  **all_plots_save_function**: compatible with Giotto instructions and
   helps to automatically save generated plots
-  **determine_cores**: to determine the number of cores to use if a
   user does not set this explicitly
-  **get_os**: to identify the operating system
-  **update_giotto_params**: will catch and store the parameters for
   each used command on a giotto object
-  **package_check**: to check if a package exists, works for packages
   on CRAN, Bioconductor and Github.

The last function should be used within your contribution code. It has
the additional benefit that it will suggest the user how to download the
package if it is not available. To keep the size of Giotto within limits
we prefer not to add too many new dependencies.

Getters and Setters
-------------------

Giotto stores information in different
`slots <getting_started_gobject.html#giotto-object-structure>`__, which
can be accessed through these getters and setters functions. They can be
found in the
`accessors.R <https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto/blob/suite/R/accessors.R>`__
file.

-  **get_expression_values**: To select the expression matrix to use

-  **set_expression_values**: Sets a new expression matrix to the
   expression slot

-  **get_spatial_locations**: Get spatial locations to use

-  **set_spatial_locations**: Sets new spatial locations

-  | **get_dimReduction**: To select the dimension reduction values to
     use

-  **set_dimReduction**: Sets new dimension reduction object

-  | **get_NearestNetwork**: To select the nearest neighbor network (kNN
     or sNN) to use

-  **set_NearestNetwork**: Sets a new nearest neighbor network (kNN or
   sNN)

-  | **get_spatialNetwork**: To select the spatial network to use

-  **set_spatialNetwork**: Sets a new spatial network

-  **get_spatialGrid**: To select the spatial grid to use

-  **set_spatialGrid**: Sets a new spatial grid

-  **get_polygon_info**: Gets spatial polygon information

-  **set_polygon_info**: Set new spatial polygon information

-  **get_feature_info**: Gets spatial feature information

-  **set_feature_info**: Sets new spatial feature information

-  **get_spatial_enrichment**: Gets spatial enrichment information

-  **set_spatial_enrichment**: Sets new spatial enrichment information

Python code
-----------

To use Python code we prefer to create a python wrapper/functions around
the python code, which can then be sourced by reticulate. As an example
we show the basic principles of how we implemented the Leiden clustering
algorithm.

1. write python wrapper and store as python_leiden.py in */inst/python*:

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: python

      import igraph as ig
      import leidenalg as la
      import pandas as pd
      import networkx as nx

      def python_leiden(df, partition_type, initial_membership=None, weights=None, n_iterations=2, seed=None, resolution_parameter = 1):
          
          # create networkx object
          Gx = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df = df, source = 'from', target =  'to', edge_attr = 'weight')  
          
          # get weight attribute
          myweights = nx.get_edge_attributes(Gx, 'weight')

          ....

          return(leiden_dfr)

2. source python code with reticulate:

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      python_leiden_function = system.file("python", "python_leiden.py", package = 'Giotto')
      reticulate::source_python(file = python_leiden_function)

3. use python code as if R code:
   See **doLeidenCLuster** for more detailed information.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

       pyth_leid_result = python_leiden(df = network_edge_dt,
                                         partition_type = partition_type,
                                         initial_membership = init_membership,
                                         weights = 'weight',
                                         n_iterations = n_iterations,
                                         seed = seed_number,
                                         resolution_parameter = resolution)

Example
-------

As an example we show the implementation of SPARK, which is a recent
method developed by `Sun et
al <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0701-7>`__ and provide some
comments within the code.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

                       percentage = 0.1,

                       expression_values = 'raw',
                       num_core = 5,
